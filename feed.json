Play</h3>\n<p>- Play one character card from your hand to an open space on the board.<br>- The character card you play must be placed “right side up” from your perspective.</p>\n<h3>2. Process</h3>\n<p>- Compare the numbers on your character card you just played to each of your opponents’ adjacent character cards. Always process starting with your character’s top number first, then continue around your card clockwise (top, right, bottom, left).<br><br>When comparing each side with an opponents’ character’s number:<br>- If your card's number is higher: capture their card from the board (keep it until the end of the game) then continue processing.<br>- If it is a tie: do NOT remove their card, just continue processing.<br>- If your card's number is lower: do NOT remove their card and STOP processing. Your card stays on the board, but you do not get to capture their card or process any more numbers around your card.</p>\n<h3>3. Draw</h3>\n<p>- Draw one card from the top of your character deck into your hand.<br>- If your deck runs out, continue playing the game as normal until all cards have been played.</p>\n<h2>End of the Game</h2>\n<p>The game ends when both players have played all of their cards, or it can end early if the board is completely filled and no spaces are open.</p>\n<h3>Determine how many points you have as follows:</h3>\n<p>- 1 point for each opponent’s character card you captured.<br>- 1 point for each corner space on the board your characters occupy.<br>- 2 points for each side space on the board your characters occupy.<br>- 3 points if your character occupies the middle space on the board.<br>- The player with the most points wins the game!</p>",
